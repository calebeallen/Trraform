          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Changes to the Terms or the Service</h2>
          <p>We may revise these Terms or modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time. When we make material changes, we will post a notice in‑Service unless an immediate change is required due to legal obligation. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="eligibility">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Eligibility &amp; Requirements to Access</h2>

            <li><strong>Age.</strong> You must be at least 13 years old. If you are under 18, a parent or legal guardian must review and accept these Terms on your behalf. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 and will delete such data if discovered.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical needs.</strong> A stable internet connection, a modern WebGL‑capable browser with JavaScript enabled, and compatible hardware are required.</li>
            <li><strong>No automated access.</strong> Scraping, crawling, bulk‑downloading, or automated collection of data—including for AI‑model training—without our prior written consent is prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Export control.</strong> You represent that you are not located in an embargoed country or a prohibited party under U.S. export laws. The software is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- 5 -->
        <div id="account">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Account Registration &amp; Security</h2>
          <p>You may register using Google OAuth or an email/password. Passwords are salted and hashed with bcrypt. Usernames must be 3–32 characters, unique, and may contain alphanumerics, “_”, and “.” only. You are responsible for all activity under your credentials. We may reclaim inactive usernames or suspend accounts that violate these Terms.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 6 -->
        <div id="license">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">License to Use the Service</h2>
          <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, and non‑sublicensable license to access and use the Service for personal, non‑commercial purposes. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Trraform.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 7 -->
        <div id="plots">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Virtual Items – Plots &amp; Credits</h2>
          <ul class="ml-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
            <li><strong>Plots are licensed, not sold.</strong> Initial prices (USD): depth 0 $3.99, depth 1 $2.99, depth 2 $1.99. Prices and supply may change.</li>
            <li>Each account receives one free plot credit. Credits are non‑transferable, do not expire, and do not guarantee availability.</li>
            <li>Virtual Items have no real‑world monetary value and are not redeemable or refundable for cash.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- 8 -->
        <div id="subscription">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Subscriptions</h2>
          <p>The monthly subscription costs $3.99 via Stripe and auto‑renews unless canceled. Benefits include a verification badge, a nametag above all owned plots, an increased build‑size limit (64 × 64 × 64), and one plot credit per renewal for the first six successful renewals.</p>
          <p><strong>Cancellation.</strong>Users can cancel their subscriptions at anytime by navigating to their profile and selecting the "Cancel subscription" option. Users will retain access to all subscription exclusive features until the end of the current billing cycle. Users can renew their subscription at anytime. Upon cancellation, users will lose access to all subscription benefits with the exception of plot credits they already received from previous renews. Builds larger than 32 × 32 × 32 will be hidden from public display but remain accessible and downloadable by the user.</p>
          <p><strong>Payment failures.</strong> Stripe retries failed payments for 7 days. If recovery fails, the subscription lapses and benefits are removed immediately. Standard cancellation procedure will apply.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 9 -->
        <div id="refunds">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Refunds, Chargebacks &amp; Fraud</h2>
          <p>All sales are final except where a paid digital item or service is not delivered due to a verifiable error on our side; in that case we will issue a full refund to the original payment method. Initiating a chargeback automatically voids the related plots, credits, and subscription benefits and may result in account suspension or termination.</p>

        <div id="ugc">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">User‑Generated Content &amp; License Grant</h2>
          <p>The Service is entirely public. By uploading or creating Content you grant Trraform a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty‑free, sub‑licensable license to host, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display, and otherwise use the Content for any purpose related to operating, promoting, or improving the Service. You represent that you have all rights necessary to grant this license.</p>
